<p style="font-size:130%;">This is Max. He is 12 years old. Max is the most calm of the two dogs and much rather spend his time laying on the couch than going on long walks.<p/>

<p style="font-size:130%;">This is Oscar. He is the younger of the two dogs. Oscar can never seem to stay still and loves going for long hikes.
