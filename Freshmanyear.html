<hr />
<p style="font-size:130%;">Before coming to the University of Maine I was pretty nervous because it is a good distance away from home. I now grew to love the school and I have met so many amazing people.</p>

<p style="font-size:130%;">I am so happy with all the friends that I have made since I've been here. I have already made so many amazing memories with them.</p>

<p style="font-size:130%;">Attending Umaine gave me so many opportunities to visit many beautiful places, my favorite was definitely Acadia. </p>
